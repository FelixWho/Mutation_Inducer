calculate_overall_mutation_rate.py takes in a VCF and ROI file, outputting the mutation rate for the whole ROI stretch.

MutationGenerator.py utilizes pyVCF to generate random mutations when given a VCF file.

MutationGeneratorTrivial.py does the same as MutationGenerator.py but without using the pyVCF class.
